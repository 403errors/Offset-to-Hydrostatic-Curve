## Project-info (Python3):
- This was a one-week 10-member group project [NA21B059-68] conducted under core course OE1012, instructed by the course instructor.
- In file oe1012.py, the first half part of the team used the offset data table provided by the instructor to get ship properties using ship formulas.
- In main.py, the second part of the team used those calculated ship properties and, by using some ship rules, modified values according to the requirements and plotted individual line curves.
- First part, built-in-python array properties were used and in second part **numpy**, **scipy** and **matplotlib.plotly** were used to draw curves.
